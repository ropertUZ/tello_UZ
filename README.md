This repository contains two demos implemented in pyhon to run in ROS on a base station controlling Tello drone platforms:
* trajectory_gen: demo to run different trayectory generation alternatives with one or multiple drones, using an external optiTrack system as global localization system. This work is the result of the final degree project of Lucia Arribas (https://github.com/luciaarribas/catkin_ws)
* tracking_demo: demo to run visual tracking based on YOLO.  This work is the result of the final degree project of Patricia Garcia (https://github.com/Patriigb/TFG)
