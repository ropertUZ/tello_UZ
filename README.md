This repository contains two demos implemented in pyhon to run in ROS on a base station controlling Tello drone platforms:
* trajectory_gen: demo to run different trayectory generation alternatives with one or multiple drones, using an external optiTrack system as global localization system
* tracking_demo: demo to run visual tracking based on YOLO
